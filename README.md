## Introduction

This repository is a personal challenge to enhance my problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. The main aim is to consistently practice and improve coding skills by tackling a variety of problems available on LeetCode.

## Goals

- Solve one LeetCode DSA problem every day for 365 days.
- Implement solutions in C++.
- Document the thought process, approach, and code for each problem.
- Track progress and share insights gained through the challenge.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Day1/` to `Day365/`**: Each day's challenge is organized in its respective directory.
  - **`README.md`**: Provides details about the problem, approach, and the C++ solution.
  - **`Solution.cpp`**: Contains the C++ code for solving the problem.

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository as a reference for C++ solutions to various LeetCode DSA problems. Each day's directory includes a README file that explains the problem and the thought process behind the solution.

To run the code, simply copy the contents of the `Solution.cpp` file into your C++ development environment or compiler.

## Contributing

While this repository is mainly a personal challenge, contributions and feedback are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or spot errors in the code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the idea of consistent daily practice and learning. Special thanks to the LeetCode community for providing a platform to hone coding skills.
